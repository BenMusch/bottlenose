        Does your code make a distinction between public interfaces and private implementation?
      correctAnswer: Yes
      parts:
        - codeTag: "Tag the line defining the interface"
        - codeTag: "Tag the line implementing that interface."
      rubric:
        - 1: if Yes, and their code is correctly tagged
        - 0.75: if they answered No, but their code is actually correct
        - 0.25: if Yes, but their code is wrong
        - 0.1: if they answered No and their code is wrong

        On a scale of 0 (worst) to 1 (best), how well do you think your
        model is designed?  This question is where the TAs will assess
        your overall design.

      rubric:
        - 1: flawless
        - 0.8: well-separated concepts, but some oddly-tight coupling between them
        - 0.5: "it works, but it's not well designed"
        - 0.1: "it doesn't appear to work, but something was submitted"

        Eventually, views will need to process all the data in your
        model.  Some views will care about all the data; others will
        need just some portion of it.  How easy is it to
        retrieve data from your model?
      options:
        - >-
          Easy: there is a single method a client can use to retrieve
          exactly the data it wishes.
        - >-
          Medium: there is a method a client can use to retrieve all
          data, and the client can then select what it needs.
        - "Impossible: clients cannot retrieve the data at all"
        - other
      parts:

            Tag the first line in the interface that declare the methods that
            accomplish this.
      rubric:
        - 1: if Easy, and it is in fact easy
        - 0.5: if Medium, and it is in fact medium
        - 0: if Impossible, and it is in fact impossible
- Testing:
  - YesNo:

      correctAnswer: Yes
      prompt: Do you have a test for the empty model?
      parts:
        - codeTag: Tag it.
      rubric:
        - 1: "Yes"
        - 0.5: Maybe -- they might have something that incidentally tests an empty model
        - 0: "No"
